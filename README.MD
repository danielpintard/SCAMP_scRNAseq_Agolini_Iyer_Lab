# Differential Expression of SCAMPs in Young and Aged Murine Satellite Cells
## Daniel Pintard, Susan Agolini, & Shama Iyer

This is the code for the workflow necesary for generating the metrics and figures that were presented in my poster. Pay close attention to the `Markdown` text and comments (#) in the code. You can import this into an IDE. I personally use Visual Studio Code, but Google Colabatory should work. You will need to make sure certain dependencies are installed in order to work with certain packages that are required for analysis and producing the figures. The 'scRNAseq1.yaml' file can be used to build the environment necessary for running this analysis using Anaconda. Follow this link to figure out how this can be done: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

You can start with any notebook in the `analysis_nbs` folder to process the data and generate the figures. The annotated data object has been saved in multiple intermediate files for the sake of speeding up the pipeline and making the repository more modular. 

The data can be downloaded from this Google Drive Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MIqZ1igaaJsa6HTi3zfTgZelMFWtmBkl?usp=sharing
